# Human Rights and Policy Considerations Research Group

The Human Rights and Policy Considerations (HRPC) Research Group (RG) aims to explore the relationship between Internet architecture and human rights for a wide audience. It aims to inform the technical community of how the design of protocols impacts, and can be informed by, policies that serve the public interest and protect human rights. It also aims to inform policy makers and civil society groups of technical constraints that might impact policy choices. The role of the research group is to promote understanding of the issues so those making decisions can do so in an informed manner.

## Background

The research group takes as its starting point the problem statement that human-rights-enabling characteristics of the Internet might be degraded if they are not properly defined, described, and sufficiently taken into account in protocol and standards development. Not protecting these characteristics could result in (partial) loss of functionality and connectivity.

Moreover, it is widely accepted that technical design decisions about the Internet are not value neutral and can have lasting impacts on public policy and individual human rights.

The Internet aims to be the global network of networks that provides unfettered connectivity to all users at all times and for any content. Open, secure, and reliable connectivity is essential for rights such as freedom of expression and freedom of association. Since the Internetâ€™s objective of connectivity intersects with human rights, its architectural design considerations converge with the human rights framework.

## Research question

Our main research question is: "How are human rights and public interest policy considered in the development of the Internet?"

We also seek to ask (in no specific order): 

- What are established models for evaluating these considerations and how do they potentially apply to Internet standards development?

- Which human rights are strengthened and which are weakened by a given protocol's design decision?

- Which protocol's design decisions benefit from an established model that evaluates human rights and public interest policy considerations?

The HRPC RG is is chartered to research protocol development that is responsible towards and mindful of human rights, and to explore whether standards and protocols can enable, strengthen or threaten human rights, as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) [1] and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) [2].

Furthermore HRPC researches how protocols can influence policy concerns that intersect with human rights, and vice versa. This research group is a discursive resource for the community to support the protocol development process in recognizing these potential public policy impacts, as well assist to address those impacts adequately. The Global Data Protection Regulation [3] and the principles of necessity and proportionality of surveillance [4] are examples of policy developments that have led to rich areas of work for the IETF through the Privacy Enhancements and Assessments Research Group (PEARG). More such regulatory actions are expected as the digital age progresses.

The HRPC Research Group collaborates with other research groups: with PEARG on privacy as a human right, with Global Access to the Internet for All (GAIA) on second-generation equity rights, with Research and Analysis of Standard-Setting Processes Research Group (RASPRG) on analyzing how discussion of core architectural principles make value judgements, and with the Measurement and Analysis for Protocols Research Group (MAPRG) on data analysis and visualization.

## Objectives

 * To expose the relations between protocols and values, with a focus on the human rights framework, such as the policy implications of  technology choices and the technical implications of policy choices.

 * To suggest guidelines to protect the Internet as a human-rights-enabling environment and a global public good in future protocol development.

 * To increase the awareness in both the human rights community and the technical community of the importance of the Internet's technical workings and their impact on human rights and the public interest.

 * To create a place for discussions and analysis of the relationship between protocol development, and their human rights and policy implications by, among other mechanisms, serving as a bridge between the human rights and the protocol development communities.

## Outputs

The research group plans on using a variety of research methods to create different outputs including, but not limited to:

 * Internet-Drafts, some of which may be published in the IRTF RFC stream. These will concern progress of the research group, will describe the methodologies considered, and will define possible protocol considerations.

 * Research papers for publication elsewhere concerning both policy and academic topics which can include in-depth analysis, discussions and review of the values embedded in the Internet architecture.

 * Protocol analysis, which can include data analysis and visualization of (existing) protocols to research their concrete impact on human rights and the public interest.

HRPC research group does not set policy for the IETF.
